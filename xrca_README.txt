These are response matrices for the XRCA instrument on STROBE-X.

The redistribution matrix is provided by xrca_2017-08-11.rmf.
This is the same for any instrument configuration.

The ancillary response file (ARF) contains the effective area vs energy.
To facilitate investigation of the science impact of descoping the XRCA to a smaller area,
we have provided two files:
xrca_128_2017-08-11.arf : The baseline configuration of 128 XRC units with a total area at 1.5 keV of 3.48 m^2
xrca_96_2017-08-11.arf : A descoped configuration of 96 XRC units with a total area at 1.5 keV of 2.61 m^2

Please report any questions or problems with these files!
